# CUHK Structural Estimation Method Workshop
## Introduction
This workshop aims at learning the structural estimation methods, especially its implementation. Focus will be put on combing the data with models. Two parts will be included, the first is about methodologies of structural estimation, and the second is about its application in fields like labor, trade, industrial organization, etc.

## Schedule
This workshop scheduled to be weekly, lasting for 10 or 11 weeks. For both parts, participants makes presentation in turns. 

The second part
