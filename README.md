# CUHK Structural Estimation Method Workshop
## Introduction
This workshop aims at learning the structural estimation methods, especially its implementation. Focus will be put on combing the data with models. Two parts will be included, the first is about methodologies of structural estimation, and the second is about its application in fields like labor, trade, industrial organization, etc.

## Schedule
This workshop scheduled to be weekly, lasting for 10 or 11 weeks. For both parts, participants make presentation in turns. Each meeting will be less than 2 hours, the day and time is TBD. 

Since this workshop has wide positive externality (say, benefit future CUHK or more Econ students) and has no grading like a class, participants need to make some commitment, i.e., absent no more than 3 times in total before they decide to participate. We will manage this Github repository together by uploading codes, slides and arrange it by topics. 



## Part I: Methodologies and Theories
### Estimation Methods
#### Calibration
#### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
#### General Moment Method (GMM)
#### Simulated Moment Method (SMM)
#### Non-parametric Methods

### Statistical Computation Methods
#### Expecation Maximization (EM) Algorithm
#### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)


## Part II: Topics and Practices(tentative)
For this part's presentation, use **no more than** 30 mins to make audiences know:
the key idea of models, 
the theoretical predictions, and 
the estimation targets. 

Use 45-60 mins for presenting details of estimation, including methodologies, data and implementation.
Discuss how you implement them, what difficulties you met during the process, and what you think is the key technical points. If there're some differences between your results and the paper, discuss why. For many papers, replication packages can be found easily, but we recommend do it again on your own, even with a different language. Also, reading the online appendix helps form a deeper understanding of techniques.

The main goal of the estimation part is to get familiar with the implementation of structural estimation methods, so please **replicate one paper's result (key result is enough, and if there're many countries or regions, one country is enough; some technical points can be discussed further in workshop) and upload the codes as well as slides before each workshop**, so that the coding details can be learned together. 

Group work with no more than three members and presenting own papers using structural estimation (if any) are encouraged. 
 
Below are some potential topics and related papers, which are flexible within papers and topics using structural estimation methods depending on participants.

### Topic 1: International Trade


### Topic 2: Spatial Economics



### Topic 3: Industrial Organization (or, in some sense, firm dynamics)
>Chen Z, Liu Z, Suárez Serrato J C, et al. Notching R&D investment with corporate income tax cuts in China[J]. American Economic Review, 2021, 111(7): 2065-2100.
And this one is quite challenging technically:
>König M, Storesletten K, Song Z, et al. From imitation to innovation: Where is all that Chinese R&D going?[J]. Econometrica, 2022, 90(4): 1615-1654.


### Topic 4: Structural Labor




### Topic 5: Taxation

### Topic 6: Networks Economics
